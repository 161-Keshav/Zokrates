Zokrate for verification for verifier and prover using no proof technique using the hashing function such as the sha256 algorithm.Here the verifier and date to be verified is not directly given insted the hashing 
function and the data by the prover will be provided ensuring the high security of data.
Here four private fields such a,b,c,d is used and two public fields for hashing h0,h1 is used.
